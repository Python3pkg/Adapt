	<p>Adapt is an attempt to make a general purpose and accessible tool for controlling configurable logic like FPGAs and CPLDs through various JTAG controllers on linux and maybe other systems later.</p>
	<p>There are several complications to this goal. First off, every USB adapter for controlling JTAG has its own protocol, that protocol is often undocumented, and each target chip we would be configuring (while often compliant...ish with IEEE 1532) has its own quirks that bar an absolute general solution that can just 'figure out' what to do from available standards documentation such as IEEE 1149.1 or IEEE 1532 bsd compliant documents often distributed with the chips from the manufacturers. </p>
	<p>The first two problem can be addressed by reversing as many of the USB controllers as reasonably possible. But simply implementing the controllers for these devices is not enough because there SHOULD BE DOCUMENTATION for these protocols, in case someone else wants to build something to address a failure in this project, and on general principal!</p>
	<p>The final issue will likely involve chip family specific instructions (be it classes or config files) to handle the odd ways chips like to do things. These quirks are often documented as people need to be able to program the chips through JTAG from microcontrollers (a common use case), so we aren't alone in the dark here.</p>
	<p>Current work focuses on controlling the common members of the Xilinx Coolrunner ii XC2CXXX family (primarily the 32, 64, 128, and 256), but other families and devices will follow mastery of the Coolrunner ii family.</p>

	<p>Note that some controllers do not come loaded with their full firmware and rely on the host computer to load the firmware to the device RAM. This is used to keep devices up to date and avoid manual firmware updates, though it requires configuring your system to flash the firmware everytime it is plugged in.</p>
	<p>The most common controller microcontrollers in these JTAG controllers that require boot up flashing are the Cypress EZ-USB chip family. Luckily there is a convenient open source utility for loading the firmware onto these devices called fxload which can load an intel hex file onto the devices. </p>
	<p>The primary complication with devices requiring firmware loading is not the act of loading the firmware, but distributing the copyrighted firmware binaries. For now, if you use Adapt, you will have to provide the firmware files from your own instalations of the private tools, or by following some steps that should be provided for getting the files.</p>
